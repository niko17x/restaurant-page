# restaurant-page


FOCUS TOPICS:
* ES6 Modules.
* Import / Export from .js (functions) / .css / .html files.
* Using 'tabbed' navigation - user can choose from available navigation tabs as a source to go to different pages on the site. In this case, the tabs contain Home, Menu, and Contact pages. The purpose of this is to exercise further DOM manipulation. When a user clicks on one of the tabs, the page should remove all current existing nodes for the tab and generate the new nodes (a new .js file) to populate the selected page.
* Place an emphasis on adding classes to .js for any styling with pre-loaded rules from a .css file. Instead of styling directly on the .js file to keep files separate and clean.
* Using classes and static functions along with event listeners.
